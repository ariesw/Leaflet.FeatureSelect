# Leaflet.FeatureSelect

Leaflet plugin for precise feature selection - especially useful on mobile! It
works by placing a marker in the center of the map and using that to select
any geometry type (Points, LineStrings, Polygons, MultiPoints,
MultiLineStrings, and MultiPolygons). Current support has been designed for
GeoJSON layers.
